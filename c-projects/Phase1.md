Creating projects in C is a great way to learn and deepen your understanding of programming. Here's a roadmap of project ideas, from beginner to advanced, that will help you improve your skills in C. Each project builds on the skills from the previous one, so the progression is natural.

### Beginner Projects
1. **Hello World Program** done
   - Purpose: Understand basic syntax and compiling.
   - Skills learned: Basic C syntax, using an IDE or compiler.

2. **Simple Calculator** done
   - Purpose: Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - Skills learned: Working with functions, user input, conditionals.

3. **Temperature Converter**
   - Purpose: Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
   - Skills learned: Functions, handling user input, basic math operations.

4. **Number Guessing Game**
   - Purpose: Computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it.
   - Skills learned: Random number generation, loops, conditionals.

5. **Palindrome Checker**
   - Purpose: Check if a word or number is the same forward and backward.
   - Skills learned: String manipulation, loops, conditionals.

### Intermediate Projects
6. **Simple Bank Account System**
   - Purpose: Simulate a basic banking system where users can create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
   - Skills learned: Arrays or structs, file handling (for saving account data), and functions.

7. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
   - Purpose: Build a simple text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game.
   - Skills learned: 2D arrays, game logic, condition checking, loops.

8. **File Compression Tool (RLE - Run-Length Encoding)**
   - Purpose: Implement simple file compression (RLE) to compress and decompress text files.
   - Skills learned: File handling, string manipulation, loops.

9. **Student Management System**
   - Purpose: Create a program to manage student records (add, delete, modify, view).
   - Skills learned: Structs, file handling, arrays, user interface.

10. **Simple To-Do List Application**
    - Purpose: Create a to-do list that can add, edit, and delete tasks.
    - Skills learned: Data structures (arrays, linked lists), file I/O, basic UI.

### Advanced Projects
11. **Library Management System**
    - Purpose: Simulate a library system with features like borrowing, returning, and tracking books.
    - Skills learned: Structs, file handling, linked lists, and advanced menu-driven programs.

12. **Chess Game (Command-Line)**
    - Purpose: Create a chess game that can be played by two players on the same computer.
    - Skills learned: 2D arrays for the board, game logic, structures for pieces, turn-based logic.

13. **Simple Shell Program**
    - Purpose: Build a simple Unix shell that can handle commands, pipe, and execute them.
    - Skills learned: System calls, process handling, fork/exec, string manipulation.

14. **Memory Allocation Library (like malloc, free)**
    - Purpose: Implement custom memory allocation functions similar to `malloc` and `free`.
    - Skills learned: Pointers, memory management, dynamic memory allocation.

15. **Multithreaded Web Server**
    - Purpose: Build a simple multi-threaded server that can handle multiple requests simultaneously.
    - Skills learned: Multithreading, sockets, and network programming.

16. **Data Compression Algorithms**
    - Purpose: Implement more complex compression algorithms like Huffman encoding.
    - Skills learned: Trees, bitwise operations, file handling.

17. **Operating System (OS) Kernel (Basic Version)**
    - Purpose: Implement a very basic OS kernel with basic I/O and file handling capabilities.
    - Skills learned: Low-level programming, memory management, system architecture.

### Tips for Progressing:
- **Start small**: Begin with simple programs to grasp C's syntax and paradigms.
- **Test and Debug**: Learn to use debugging tools like `gdb` to step through your code.
- **Refactor**: Once you've completed a project, revisit it and improve the code's structure.
- **Explore Libraries**: Once you're comfortable, dive into libraries like `ncurses` for building terminal-based UIs.
